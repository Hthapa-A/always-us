<h1 class="center">Almost There</h1>

<p class="center">
I don’t know what the future holds.
But I promise to remain humble,
to keep growing,
and to never let go of your hand.
</p>

<p class="center">
We are not perfect.
We are not the richest.
But we are rich in love,
rich in understanding,
and rich in hope.
</p>

<p class="center">
And for me,
that is everything.
