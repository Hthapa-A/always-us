ALsA♥️,
</p>

<p>
I don’t say this enough, but choosing you has always been the easiest decision of my life.
Through failures, distance, and uncertainty, you remained my constant.
</p>

<p>
We’ve failed.
We’ve struggled.
We’ve fallen.
But we’ve risen too.
And every time I stood back up, it was because of you.
</p>

<p>
We may not have everything the world considers valuable,
but we have something far greater — each other.
Even on our darkest days, we chose to smile.
We chose love.
We chose hope.
</p>

<p>
I’ve never dreamed of a luxurious life.
All I ever wanted was a peaceful one —
where I never have to see you in pain,
where I walk beside you, holding your hand,
through every season of life.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for believing in me when I felt like nothing.
Thank you for waiting.
Thank you for loving me the way you do.
</p>

<p class="signature">
Forever yours.
</p>
