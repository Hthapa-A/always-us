    <h2>2019 — When We Met</h2>
    <p>
      Life was heavy back then. I had just appeared in my Grade 11 board exams and scored well.
      My old school even awarded me a 25,000 NPR cash prize, which I went back to claim during Dashain in Chautara.
      I was just trying to survive — no big dreams, no romantic thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      While standing in the queue at Nepal Bank, cheque in my hand, I saw you.
      A familiar face I had once seen during the SEE exams.
      You were there with your mom.
      We didn’t speak.
      Yet something shifted inside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ordinary moment became the beginning of an extraordinary story.
      A light appeared in my dark, uncertain world.

    <h2>2024 — Distance Began</h2>
    <p>
      We talked every night from 9 to 10 PM.
      The rest of the day, we studied with dedication.
      We were young, focused, and unknowingly falling in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the world stopped.
      COVID-19 shattered plans, delayed dreams, and tested patience.
      You aimed for BDS.
      I dreamed of becoming an engineer.
      Suddenly, everything felt uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cried together.
      We laughed through tears.
      Even without words, we knew love was there — silently holding us close.

    <h2>2025 — Still Choosing Each Other</h2>
    <p>
      Failures came one after another.
      Army attempts.
      Exams.
      Rejections.
      I broke down completely.
      I felt like I had failed my family, myself, and my future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you never left.
      Your words healed what no medicine ever could.
      You believed in me when I had nothing left to believe in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, something magical happened.
      You confessed that you loved me.
      After waiting so long, I finally had you.
      ALsA♥️, you became my strength, my calm, my reason to keep going.

    <h2>2026 — Almost Home</h2>
    <p>
      I came to the UK.
      Life taught me the real value of time, money, family, and loved ones.
      Every day, I am quietly growing.
      Silently fighting battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distance is still here — but it’s losing.
      The end is visible.
      Every sacrifice is finally making sense.
    </p>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>2027 & Beyond — Always Together</h2>
    <p>
      No more countdowns.
      No more waiting.
      Just ordinary mornings, shared dreams, and a peaceful life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distance didn’t break us.
      It trained us.
